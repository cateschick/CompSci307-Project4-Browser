This project implements a web browser.

Name: Cate Schick

### Timeline

Start Date: September 19th, 2021

Finish Date: September 21st, 2021

Hours Spent: ~18 hours (mostly spent trying to separate the model from view)

### Tutorial and other Resources Used
I read the articles about various frontend design options for ComboBox, ToolBar, and InputTextDialogs

### Resource Attributions

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: N/A

Key/Mouse inputs:

Known Bugs:

*TESTING*
I struggled implementing some of my model tests mostly due to the fact that I need to figure out how to keep my view from being null
while trying to test my backend methods. Logically, though, the tests should accurately assess my backend 
once that bug is smoothed over.

*FAVORITES LIST*:
Currently, my browser System.out.prints the current list of favorites but does not show it on the screen; this
was due to me struggling on how to implement this favorites list on the frontend.

*Dynamically changing button names*
This is reflected in my two buttons relating to home: one "go to home" button, and one "set as home" button.

### Notes/Assumptions
This was harder to implement than I thought! Separating the model and the view took so much of my time spent
on this project compared to the new features.

An initial error I made to simply move all my methods around, then fix the red lines. I quickly realized I had to 
go one method at a time to keep the whole browser from crashing.

### Impressions
This project seems really useful; I think this would be a good project to talk about in some interviews that I have
coming up.

I plan on adding more edits to this project as the semester goes on for fun.
